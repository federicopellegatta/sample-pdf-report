# PDF Report Generator with PDFBox and Thymeleaf

The Spring Boot PDF Report Generator is a sample Java application that leverages the power
of [OpenHTMLtoPDF](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf), [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/)
and [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) to dynamically create PDF reports.
This application is designed to simplify the process of generating professional-quality PDF documents from your data,
making it an ideal solution for businesses, developers, and organizations seeking to automate their report generation
workflows.

This application, specifically designed as a sample, showcases the capabilities of these technologies through a
simulated school register scenario. It demonstrates how these tools can be employed to create student progress
reports, class schedules, and other educational documents.

### Key Features

1. **Spring Boot Framework:** This sample is built on the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust foundation for
   development and integration with other Spring Boot projects.
